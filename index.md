## Overview

The [Trusted Analytics Platform (TAP)](http://www.trustedanalytics.org) is a Platform-as-a-Service cloud stack for data scientists and application developers to build and operate domain-specific applications driven by data analysis at scale.

* [Data Platform](mydoc_data_platform)
* [Application Platform](mydoc_application_platform)

The Trusted Analytics Platform is dedicated to ensuring the security and integrity of big data storage and analytics. Read more about the [platform security features](mydoc_security_features) created for TAP.  Visit the [TAP architecture](mydoc_architecture) documentation for more detailed information about design behind the platform. 

TAP includes an intuitive user interface carefully designed around a data science and  application development collaborative workflow.  Take a [walk through the TAP console](mydoc_console_walkthrough) to become familiar with the TAP experience. 

Trusted Analytics Platform (TAP) can easily be deployed on [Amazon Web Services](mydoc_deployment_aws) or as an [on premises deployment](mydoc_deployment_onprem), or you can download the [TAP sources and binaries](mydoc_deployment_sourcesandbinaries).
